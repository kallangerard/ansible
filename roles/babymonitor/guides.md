## Raspivid as a service

We use systemd to manage services. Thatâ€™s why I recommend this page 109 to get started. Even though it looks kinda intimidating at first, this is just robust and rigorous. In the nutshell all you need to do:

create a simple service file (for example, let it be raspicam.service) which contains something like this:

```
[Unit]
Description=raspivid
After=network.target

[Service]
ExecStart=/usr/bin/raspivid -n ....

[Install]
WantedBy=default.target
```

put it in /etc/systemd/system/

sudo systemctl daemon-reload to let systemd know of this service

sudo systemctl start raspivid to test it out

sudo systemctl enable raspivid to enable on boot
